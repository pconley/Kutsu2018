                    <h2 class="area-title">Our History</h2>
                    <p><%= bold %> was founded in St. Louis, Missouri in 1943. The late Ruth Rubin-Feldman created the organization as a support for polio survivors. Herself a survivor of polio, Ms. Feldman had feet of significantly different sizes. When wartime rationing made buying two sizes even more difficult, she conceived the idea of a service whereby people with similar problems could register their names and sizes. The registry served as a clearing-house that put people with similar interests and tastes, but opposite foot sizes, in touch with one another. Together the new friends could buy footwear and share the cost. No shoes were wasted and they saved money!</p>
                    <p>With many veterans coming home from the war as amputees, the service grew and broadened its scope. First Lady Elenor Roosevelt gave <b><i>National Odd Shoe Exchange</i></b> nationwide recognition for providing such a valuable service.</p>
                    <p>Today, <%= name %> is no longer disease-specific, but assists people with a variety of conditions and life-styles. NATIONAL ODD SHOE EXCHANGE ships new, quality footwear to children, adults and seniors across the United States and Canada from its distribution center in Arizona.</p>
