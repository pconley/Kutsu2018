  it "has a basic factory bot" do
    # Returns a User instance that's not saved
    agent = FactoryBot.build(:agent)
    expect(agent).to be_valid
  end


# Returns a saved User instance
agent = create(:agent)

# Returns a hash of attributes that can be used to build a User instance
attrs = attributes_for(:agent)

# Returns an object with all defined attributes stubbed out
stub = build_stubbed(:agent)

# Passing a block to any of the methods above will yield the return object
create(:agent) do |agent|
  agent.posts.create(attributes_for(:post))
end

# Build a User instance and override the first_name property
user = build(:user, first_name: "Joe")
user.first_name
# => "Joe"
